                    <p>Memecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that often starts as a joke or parody, driven by internet
                        culture and memes. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are
                        designed to serve specific purposes such as decentralized finance or smart contracts, memecoins
                        often have little to no inherent utility or technological innovation. Despite this, they have
                        gained massive popularity and market attention. This phenomenon is a testament to the influence
                        of social media, viral internet trends, and the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market.
                    </p>

                    <p>Memecoins began to gain traction in the cryptocurrency space with Dogecoin in 2013. Created by
                        software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a joke based on the popular Shiba Inu dog
                        meme from the internet, Dogecoin became a symbol of fun and lightheartedness within the crypto
                        community. Initially, it had little value, but thanks to its active community and occasional
                        celebrity endorsements (including Elon Musk), Dogecoin went on to achieve multi-billion-dollar
                        valuations.</p>

                    <p>Following the success of Dogecoin, a variety of other memecoins emerged, including Shiba Inu
                        (often referred to as the "Dogecoin killer"), SafeMoon, and more. These coins typically ride the
                        wave of viral trends, influencer endorsements, and social media hype rather than being driven by
                        technological advancements or real-world use cases.

                <p>I'm a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that blend
                    thoughtful design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and
                    development, creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for
                    performance and usability.</p>

                <p>Currently, I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer at <strong>Klaviyo</strong>, specializing in
                    accessibility. I contribute to the creation and maintenance of UI components that power Klaviyo’s
                    frontend, ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards and best practices to deliver an
                    inclusive user experience.</p>

                <p>In the past, I've had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings — from
                    <strong>advertising agencies</strong> and <strong>large corporations</strong> to
                    <strong>start-ups</strong> and <strong>small digital product studios</strong>. Additionally, I also
                    released a <strong>comprehensive video course</strong> a few years ago, guiding learners through
                    building a web app with the Spotify API.
